## How to deploy to netlify

* EDN files are deployed by CircleCI automatically.
  * All steps are in [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml).
    * The job is triggered by cron [every day](https://github.com/liquidz/clojuredocs-export-edn/blob/b9edb899e0a5402fc82f43afa72cb61e047545bf/.circleci/config.yml#L48-L55).
* All you need is to add these environment variables to CircleCI.
  * `NETLIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` which can be created [here](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens)
  * `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` which is your site's API ID
* Steps to deploy manually is below.
```console
# EDN files are generated in ./target/out/
bash generate.sh

# Install netlify-cli
sudo npm install -g --silent netlify-cli

# Deploy EDN files via netlify-cli
netlify deploy \
    --auth=${NETLIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN} \
    --site=${NETLIFY_SITE_ID} \
    --dir=target/out \
